      <li>
        Peel off a few strips of cucumber skin using a channel knife, creating a
        striped pattern. Cut cucumbers in half crosswise. Cut each half into
        quarters before cutting into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices. Place into a
        colander; toss with some kosher salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half. Rinse cucumbers; drain
        thoroughly for 10 to 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cucumbers are draining, slice onion thinly. Cut bell pepper into
        strips. Turn knife diagonally and cut strips into diamond-shaped pieces.
        Slice Kalamata and green olives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, and 2
        tablespoons oregano in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and
        cayenne. Sprinkle in vinegar and toss thoroughly. Drizzle in olive oil.
        Add about 2/3 of the feta cheese and toss again. Cover with plastic wrap
        and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Give the salad another mix. Taste and season as desired. Scatter
        remaining feta cheese on top and garnish with remaining oregano.
